# DECIDED.md — one-grep index of settled questions

*Grep THIS FILE before probing, designing, or writing anything up as an open
question.  One line per decision: keywords, the ruling, the pointer to the
authoritative text.  This file is an INDEX — never put the full argument
here.  When a session settles a question (user ruling, Fable review, design
doc), add a line in the same commit.  When a line turns out wrong, fix the
authoritative doc first, then the line.*

*Origin: s316v wasted real time re-deriving four already-settled facts
(review doc §7).  The rule now: read failing test → grep DECIDED.md → grep
not-supported.md → only then probe.*

## Semantics / language policy

- **DESTROY**: not fired in ANY shape (scope exit, undef, reassign, sub
  return) → `not-supported.md` §DESTROY.  Re-open as scoped R2 feature =
  OPEN user decision (`fable-answers-s316v.md` §6c).
- **Error-message text / invalid-input detection**: out of scope — PCL
  transpiles valid Perl, exact fatal text not a goal (user 2026-07-28) →
  `not-supported.md` §Error message text + CLAUDE.md 9.  Blanket
  skip-registry category approved (`fable-answers-s316v.md` §6d).
- **Ref identity / refaddr / `CODE(0x…)` / `==` on refs**: monotonic
  never-reused ids, stable across GC — deliberately NOT raw pointers →
  `ir-spec.md` §2.5.
- **Host-visible values, how far to chase perl's bytes**: match perl's
  SHAPE and invariants, not its bytes; where perl's bytes carry a defect,
  do better; exact bytes only where a program can branch on them (e.g.
  seeded rand → drand48) → `ir-spec.md` (rule), `fable-answers-s316v.md` §6h.
- **`eval $str`**: HARD REQUIREMENT, must always work, never gated (user
  2026-07-07).
- **Speed vs readable generated CL**: performance wins (user 2026-07-02) →
  CLAUDE.md §2.
- **Bareword class names** (`tie $x, Tie::StdHash`): per-builtin
  class-name-ARGUMENT-position rule reusing the `bless` bareword mechanism
  (ExprToCL `$is_bareword`), NEVER a global bareword→string rule — three
  failed global attempts recorded in task #142 → `fable-answers-s316v.md` §1.
- **PExpr operand-boundary region** (`$end_pars` maze, PExpr.pm ~2600-3700):
  do NOT add guards there; the fix is Option B's `_reduce_term` →
  `pexpr-term-parsing-review.md`.  #147 and the #138 state-init residual
  WAIT for it (`fable-answers-s316v.md` §6e, §4).
- **Flip-flop constant operands** (`"x" .. 3` vs `$.`): classify per-operand
  at the existing codegen `p-flipflop*` selection point → task #141,
  `fable-answers-s316v.md` §2.
- **quotemeta / `\w`-sensitive builtins / no per-scalar UTF8 flag**: default
  is perl's BYTE semantics; Unicode rules only under `use utf8` /
  `unicode_strings`, selected at transpile time per scope → task #146,
  `fable-answers-s316v.md` §6b.
- **pack/unpack `U` character-vs-byte modes**: implement the real mode model
  (default character mode; `U0`/`C0` switches); anything not implemented
  DIES loudly, never a silent wrong value → task #148,
  `fable-answers-s316v.md` §6j.
- **`printf %n`**: OPEN — user policy call (recommendation: bless as
  not-supported) → task #143, `fable-answers-s316v.md` §6a.
- **Aggregate state model** (tie/readonly/referent-kind — #154-residue,
  #155, #159, #163): side table REJECTED (mutation-path tax); boxed
  aggregates = E5-era Fable design, do NOT start; referent-kind tag on the
  box APPROVED post-R1 (fixes #163 ref identity/printed type + #154's two
  shapes) → `fable-answers-s318.md` §1.
- **tie on ARRAY/HASH**: interim = loud stderr WARNING + not-supported
  subsection (NOT a die — would CRASH avhv.t-class files); real support
  waits for boxed aggregates → `fable-answers-s318.md` §1, task #155.
  SHIPPED s320: `%p-warn-aggregate-tie` in `pcl-runtime.lisp`, one line per
  (kind, class) per process so a tie in a loop stays one line.
- **Read-only aggregates** (`Internals::SvREADONLY(@a,1)`): storage-swap to
  a simple vector, post-R1; never a weak-hash probe on the push path; do
  not bless as not-supported → `fable-answers-s318.md` §2, task #159.
- **`do SUBNAME(LIST)`**: NO fix — pre-5.20 perl called the sub and PCL
  keeps that semantics; modern perl's rejection is principle-9 material
  (register do.t t63/t65, nothing near `$end_pars`) →
  `fable-answers-s318.md` §4, task #158.  Measured s320: the family is
  **four** rows, t63-t66 (one `foreach my $mode` over `subname("arg")`,
  `subname()`, `$subref("arg")`, `$subref()`, each asserting
  `$@ =~ /\Asyntax error/`), and do.t's **2 PCL-only extra TAP numbers are
  those same rows' `fail()` guard firing** — not a separate defect.  op/do.t
  still reads DIFF (65/8) and gets NO expected.tsv row: t67 (delete-helem
  result copied), t68 (RT 124248 DESTROY-by-GC) and t70 (`$@` false on
  `do DIR`) are unexplained, and the registration bar is all-or-nothing.
- **chr() above U+10FFFF**: blessed — SBCL `char-code-limit` = #x110000,
  U+FFFD is the answer; op/chr.t → XDIFF → `fable-answers-s318.md` §11,
  `not-supported.md` §Unicode, task #173.  SHIPPED s320 (verified XDIFF:
  t10-13 `use bytes` + t40-42 above-Unicode = all 7 rows).  `ord` still
  round-trips the number — only the character/encoded form is lost.
- **#149 application**: per-ROW; side-effect/value/behaviour assertions on
  VALID Perl never register; interleave, never a campaign →
  `fable-answers-s318.md` §3.
- **:crlf layer model** (#139) and **source-echo comments** (#132):
  user-held design decisions — do not start.
- **`**` float divergence**: parked → memory `project_power_op_float_divergence`.
- **mro**: C3-only, no `mro::` API / `next::method` yet →
  `not-supported.md` §mro, provider planned in `mro-plan.md`.
- **@_ aliasing, Unicode limits, and every other blessed gap**: grep
  `not-supported.md` FIRST — the answer is often already there.

## Coding rules (the ones people trip over)

- **Missing case DIES, never defaults**: a runtime `cond`/dispatch over a
  closed set of legal values ends in an explicit error naming the value,
  not a `(t …)` default — silent-wrong is the worst failure mode in the
  tree (vec-64, #138 silent drop) → CLAUDE.md 12, audit task #152.
- **Fix at the right LAYER**: module behavior → `lib/` shim; mechanisms →
  parser; core semantics → runtime → CLAUDE.md 9a.
- **Reuse, don't duplicate**: find the sibling mechanism; same logic in two
  places = hard stop → CLAUDE.md 11.
- **Never simplify a failing test**; skip only via the registry →
  CLAUDE.md 5, `test-skip-registry.md`.
- **Checked-in transpiled artifacts** (`cl/pcl-pack.lisp`, `cl/pcl-mro.lisp`):
  regenerate after emission changes (`tools/rebuild-pack`; pl2cl lib/mro.pm)
  → CLAUDE.md §Quick Reference.
- **Emission change ⇒ bump `*pcl-cache-generation*`** or stale caches run
  old codegen → CLAUDE.md §Pipelines.

## Test / triage infrastructure

- **`docs/perl-suite-run.tsv` columns**: `P`=PERL, `C`=PCL (C for CL);
  `NOTAP` means PERL produced no TAP (row not comparable — says nothing
  bad about PCL) → legend at top of the tsv; source
  `tools/run-perl-suite.pl`.
- **`.suitelog/*.fails.tsv` description column is PERL's test line**, values
  interpolated by perl — never read it as PCL's output.
- **A run that comes back all/mostly NOTAP means the FIXTURE is broken, not
  the files**: the perl side runs with CWD = the real `t/`, so `require
  './test.pl'` must find PERL's 2000-line harness; with PCL's ~400-line stub
  there instead, real perl cannot even compile `plan tests => N` and emits
  zero TAP.  This is what made io/defout.t / op/localref.t / uni/bless.t look
  NOTAP in s316v (a `cp` had followed a symlink onto the real file).  The
  runner now dies on that instead of producing the misleading run
  → `tools/run-perl-suite.pl` fixture-sanity block, task #151.
- **XDIFF registration bar**: a file gets an `perl-suite-expected.tsv` row
  ONLY when every failing test in it is explained by a blessed
  `not-supported.md` section — partially-explained files stay UNEXPLAINED
  → `perl-suite-expected.tsv` header, `fable-answers-s316v.md` §6f.
- **Copied-file corpus split**: t/ originals are authoritative; the runner
  no longer hides a t/ file behind a `perl-tests/` copy of the same name;
  drifted copies re-sync post-R1 → task #150, `fable-answers-s316v.md` §6i.
- **v1 is the emission ORACLE until E4.1** (`PCL_V1=1 ./pl2cl`) — copy its
  shape when correct, don't invent one → `v2-opus5-execution-plan.md` §2.
- **New Pl/t tests** → smallest `transpile-test-NN.t`, cap ~50/file, never
  -01 (user 2026-07-28).
- **Failed attempts are recorded IN the task** (what was tried, what killed
  it) — a task that says what NOT to retry outranks one that only states
  the goal.
- **The TAP layer must not build its own regex scanner.**  `pl-like`/
  `pl-unlike` in `cl/pcl-test.lisp` called `ppcre:create-scanner` directly,
  so `like`/`unlike` judged patterns by DIFFERENT rules than `=~` did —
  missing the cl-ppcre extended-mode workaround, and (s321) choking on the
  `/xx` option, with the `handler-case` turning the error into a quiet test
  FAILURE.  Route through `%pcl-create-scanner` → task #179, CLAUDE.md 11.
- **A qr is an OBJECT, and its `(?^flags:…)` wrapper is load-bearing.**  A
  pattern that is exactly one interpolated qr IS that qr (outer modifiers
  ignored); as PART of a bigger pattern the wrapper embeds verbatim; `/xx`
  prints two x's; and the stringification comes from the SOURCE text, not
  from any cl-ppcre rewrite.  Therefore a variable holding a qr is never
  frozen to text by the raw-slot verdict (`write-object`, `VarAnnotator`) →
  `ir-spec.md` §10 regex rows, task #181, s322.
- **NEVER join two TAP streams by test NUMBER** — pair them by DESCRIPTION
  (`tools/lib/PclTapAlign.pm`, unit-tested in `tools/t/tap-align.t`).  A
  file where PCL emits extra or missing rows mid-run then mis-attributes
  every LATER row, in both directions: op/do.t's number join accused two
  rows that PASS and credited two that fail.  Re-sync only on evidence (an
  exact desc match ahead, confirmed by the next row); value-interpolated
  and unnamed descriptions must fall back to positional pairing →
  task #177, s321.
- **A dead run must not look like a run nobody asked for**: every requested
  file gets a row (KILLED / NOT-RUN when the run died), the exit code is
  nonzero, and a journal records rows as they arrive → task #157,
  `tools/run-perl-suite.pl` header.
- **Fixture artifacts get a FIXTURE status + registry in the runner** (not
  `perl-suite-expected.tsv` — a harness artifact is not a language gap):
  #151 stub-cp, #167 splitpath-skip, #172 shadow-symlink getcwd →
  `fable-answers-s318.md` §10.  SHIPPED s320: `docs/perl-suite-fixture.tsv`
  (`file<TAB>rows<TAB>cause`), matched per TEST NUMBER and all-or-nothing —
  one unregistered failing row keeps the file DIFF and names it, a
  fully-passing registered file is STALE.  #151/#167 were FIXED, not
  registered; the file's RESOLVED list says why (its bar rule 3).
- **The suite tsv snapshot GATES R1**: one full regeneration (per-dir
  FOREGROUND chunks, `--jobs 2-4`) as the LAST pre-R1 act, after the
  FIXTURE/XDIFF hygiene lands; partial regeneration forbidden →
  `fable-answers-s318.md` §6.
- **pack.t sweep hole (#176)**: DONE s322 — the sweep **retries a TIMEOUT
  once at 3× the timeout** (`sweep-perl-tests.pl`, `--no-retry` disables).
  Ruling was `fable-answers-s321.md` §1; its step 2 (bless ~89 rows post-R1)
  turned out moot — **pack.t's 58 baseline rows were there all along** and the
  run matches them exactly.  The "0 baseline rows" claim came from grepping a
  NUL-containing tsv (grep goes binary-silent — use `grep -a`/perl).  The
  90→166 s slowdown is a separate Target-A task (#184).
- **A TIMEOUT is a measurement failure, not a result**: a timing-out file's
  baseline rows come back "unverified", so a regression inside it is invisible
  while the headline still reads "0 new" → task #176, s322.
- **Mis-attributed-evidence registrations (#177 aftermath)**: a tainted
  registration must be RE-VERIFIED before R1; reason-text corrections gate
  R1, status changes only if re-verification fails.  In `renumbered` files,
  per-row claims must quote the DESCRIPTION, not bare tNN →
  `fable-answers-s321.md` §2.  Measured radius s321: backlog empty.
- **XDIFF rows column (machine-checked like FIXTURE)**: APPROVED, POST-R1
  S3 item — backfill from the S2 snapshot, key by description, enforce
  all-or-nothing → `fable-answers-s321.md` §3.
- **op/list.t + op/pack.t are QUARANTINED** (op/list.t OOMs a 10 GB
  cgroup in 53 s, transpiler innocent); they appear as NOT-RUN rows WITH
  the #160 reason, never silently absent; diagnosis post-R1, user
  re-authorization first, suspect SBCL compile time →
  `fable-answers-s318.md` §8, task #160.  SHIPPED s320 as `%QUARANTINE` in
  `run-perl-suite.pl` — a SEPARATE mechanism from `%HEAVY` (which only runs
  a file solo).  Quarantined ≠ skipped: NOT-RUN is an UNEXPLAINED status,
  so these still fail the run and still show as a hole in the tsv.
- **Forked workers must never run the parent's END blocks or signal
  handlers** ($$ == $MAIN_PID guard): one signalled worker otherwise
  `rm -rf`s the SHARED tmpdir and kills its siblings → task #157, guard in
  `run-perl-suite.pl` + `sweep-perl-tests.pl`.
- **`File::Spec::Functions` DELEGATES to `File::Spec`** — it must never carry a
  second implementation.  The two copies drifted apart in BOTH directions and
  the `splitpath($p,1)` divergence silently changed test control flow
  (op/chdir.t's `skip("Already in t/")` never fired, so PCL RAN two tests perl
  skips) → task #167, `lib/File/Spec/Functions.pm` header.
  Corollary when probing a shim: **probe the CALL FORM the caller uses** — the
  method form was correct while the imported function form was broken.
- **A phase block (`BEGIN`/`END`/`CHECK`/`INIT`/`UNITCHECK`) is NOT a runtime
  statement**: it must be skipped when picking a block's TAIL statement, or a
  trailing `BEGIN {}` silently demotes the real last statement to void context
  → `docs/wantarray-context.md` §"a phase block is not a runtime statement",
  task #164 (open; sequence after the CLAUDE.md §8 VOID_CTX regression).
- **`system()`/backticks in an END block EAT the exit status** — `$?` at the
  end of the last END block IS the process exit code, so cleanup ENDs need
  `local $?`.  This silently zeroed run-perl-suite's exit code for every run
  it ever made → task #157.
- **A `use` inside an expression block (`do{}`/`eval{}`/anon-sub) HOISTS, and
  under v2 the hoist must not take v1's DEFERRAL path** — `_pending_hoisted_defs`
  is flushed by `_process_children`, which v2 never calls, so the `use` was
  silently dropped and only surfaced as an undefined function at run time →
  task #187, `Pl/Parser.pm` `parse_block_as_function` teardown
  (`_v2_owner`), guard `Pl/t/transpile-test-09.t`.
- **A `package` inside a do/eval block is a RUNTIME switch only** — it opens no
  CL section, so a hoisted `use` would import into the enclosing package.
  `p-use` therefore takes `:into "Pkg"`, emitted whenever the block's package
  differs from the section's → task #187.
- **An unmatched capture group is perl UNDEF, never raw CL nil** — raw nil means
  "the empty list" to `%p-flatten-list`, so a list ASSIGNMENT (`p-list-=`)
  silently shifted every later capture up a slot, while the ARRAY target
  (`p-array-=`) was correct.  `my ($d,$f) = $p =~ m{^(.*/)?(.*)}` put the
  filename in `$d` → task #188, both capture-collection sites in
  `cl/pcl-runtime.lisp`.
- **`_` is perl's stat-cache filehandle, and it is a BOUND VARIABLE in :pcl** —
  `-e $f and -f _` lowers the bareword to the bare symbol `_`, so `:pcl`
  exports a defvar holding a marker; every filetest resolves its operand
  through ONE funnel (`%p--path` → `%p-stat-arg`) that maintains the cache.
  PCL caches the PATH and re-stats where perl caches the stat BUFFER — a
  deliberate divergence, same answer outside a race → task #186.
- **`lib/File/Basename.pm` is a SHIM ONLY because `$_[N]` writes do not reach a
  plain `my` lexical** (`_strip_trailing_sep($dirname)` did nothing, so
  `dirname("/a/b/c")` answered "/a/b/").  Delete the shim when task #189 lands;
  do NOT "fix" it by blanket-boxing every lexical passed to a sub.
- **A sub Perl already knows about beats INDIRECT-OBJECT syntax** — `divide
  $text => 4` is `divide($text, 4)`, never `$text->divide(4)`.  PExpr's
  indirect pre-pass asks `_is_known_callable($name, 1)`, the same compile-time
  question `_bareword_subscript_autoquotes` asks for bareword array subscripts.
  The question must be PACKAGE-QUALIFIED there (`Widget::show` is not visible
  as a bare `show` from main — probed, the unqualified version broke it), and
  the prototype table cannot answer it because it is keyed by bare name →
  task #190; residue #191.
- **`utf8::unicode_to_native` / `native_to_unicode` are defined ONCE**, in
  `cl/pcl-runtime.lisp`.  `cl/pcl-test.lisp` used to define the same two names
  again for charset_tools.pl; since the TAP layer loads AFTER the runtime its
  copy silently won, so the function behaved differently depending on whether
  Test::More was loaded — and SBCL printed "redefining …" on stderr for 17
  files of the perl-tests sweep.  pl2cl/runtime stderr must stay clean: test
  harnesses merge it into the generated CL.
- **An UNQUALIFIED dynamic glob name resolves in the package IN EFFECT, not
  main** — `*{"_IS_\U$_"} = …` inside `package File::Path` installs
  `File::Path::_IS_MSWIN32`.  Both `p-glob-assign-dynamic` and
  `p-dynamic-typeglob` hardcoded "main" → task #192.  Follow-on #193: those
  same constants are then USED as barewords, and under `use strict` an
  undeclared bareword is a compile error, so by principle 9 anything that
  compiles is a CALL — PCL still emits some of them as strings (always true).

## s323 Fable rulings (2026-08-02, `fable-answers-s323.md`)

- **#189 `writes_args`: shape APPROVED, POST-R1** — detect in the callee body
  (lvalue set PLUS `foreach` over `@_`, lvalue substr/vec/pos, and ESCAPES:
  `\$_[N]`, `\@_`, `&callee;`, `goto &sub`, `@_` passed on — anything not
  provably read-only sets the flag), carry on `sub_info`, consume as a
  VarAnnotator `arg-to-writer` boxing reason at same-file call sites first.
  The "Cannot modify non-boxed value" warning STAYS as the backstop for
  undetected writers.  NO blanket boxing of call args, ever.  Delete
  `lib/File/Basename.pm` when it lands → `fable-answers-s323.md` §1.
- **#193 strict-subs bareword = a CALL, CONFIRMED (principle 9)** — fix at
  the string-FALLTHROUGH point, gated on strict-subs; pre-R1 attempt
  authorized, time-boxed, corpus-diff with every changed row examined;
  **stop-rule: if the trace lands in the #142 `$end_pars` region, STOP**
  (that fix is #153 `_reduce_term`) → `fable-answers-s323.md` §2.
- **#191 indirect-method-in-brackets: DEFERRED** — loud failure, rare
  syntax; re-raise on a real CPAN cause line → `fable-answers-s323.md` §3.
- **Suite-snapshot staleness rule**: a crash-fixing commit MARKS the snapshot
  stale (one session-log line, write-side); regeneration is required at
  QUOTE points (review round, release number, the R1 call), not per commit;
  next regeneration adds a `# taken-at: <commit>` header
  → `fable-answers-s323.md` §4.
- **USER (2026-08-02): R1's CPAN half gates on the FOUR-DIST baseline only**
  (`docs/cpan-scoreboard.tsv`, no regressions); the widened board is the
  post-R1 worklist, `IO`/`IO::Handle` shim first (23 of 48 FAILs)
  → `fable-answers-s323.md` §5.
- **USER (2026-08-02): fetching/unpacking CPAN dists for measurement is
  blanket-OK'd**; system-level installs still ask → `fable-answers-s323.md` §5.
- **USER (2026-08-02): the full `tools/run-perl-suite.pl --all` run (~15 min)
  runs every 3rd–5th change, NOT per change** — per change it is
  `tools/prove-core` + a targeted single-file suite run (positional
  t-relative paths); full run always once before committing a batch or
  quoting numbers.  Same shape as the s323 sweep cadence
  → `fable-answers-s323.md` §6, memory `feedback_sweep_cadence`.

## s324 (Fable, 2026-08-02): #193 + the two bugs under it

- **#193 DONE: under strict-subs an undeclared bareword before a BINARY
  operator is a CALL** — the strict gate the end-of-expression branch already
  had, added to its second copy (the followed-by-binary-operator branch in
  `handle_subcalls`; the #142 `$end_pars` branch untouched).  `=>` and `->`
  keep the string reading even under strict (fat-comma autoquote; class-name
  invocant — probed).  No-strict behavior unchanged.  Guard:
  `transpile-test-09.t` (#193 row + inverse row).
- **readdir/opendir semantics**: opendir treats its path as a DIRECTORY even
  without a trailing slash (merge-pathnames used to list the PARENT); entries
  are the child's OWN last component (a subdir used to come back as `""`);
  `.`/`..` are included; symlinks unresolved; **readdir is
  wantarray-sensitive** (`%WANTARRAY_SENSITIVE`, list context drains to a
  vector) → `cl/pcl-runtime.lisp` `%p-opendir-impl`/`%p-readdir-impl`,
  session-log s324.
- **A sole-ternary parenthesized lvalue is a SCALAR assignment** —
  `($c ? $a : $b) = V` gives V scalar context and the expression's value is
  the assigned value (never the list-assignment COUNT), so while-loop
  implicit defined() applies; emitted as `(box-set (p-if …) V)` via
  `_sole_ternary_lvalue_id` in BOTH '=' emitters, with box-set arms in both
  auto-defined matchers → defins.t t10, session-log s324.

## R1 (2026-08-02)

- **R1 IS CALLED (user, 2026-08-02, session s325) at `dc6ce64`, tag `R1`.**
  R1 = correctness-by-gate.  The checklist that grounds it: Pl/t gate
  `Result: PASS` 125 files / 4479 tests; full sweep 18461/926 with
  sweep-diff 0 new / 0 fixed vs the 689-row baseline; four-dist CPAN board
  zero regressions (one improvement, Try-Tiny `00-report-prereqs.t`
  FAIL→PASS via #193, baseline advanced); suite snapshot current and
  stamped (`# taken-at:` in `docs/perl-suite-run.tsv`; the 7 TIMEOUT rows
  re-verified at `--timeout 300`, task #195); artifacts regenerated at gen
  v2-95 (bodies byte-identical) → numbers in `docs/session-log.md` s325.
  **The post-R1 backlog is now ACTIVE in its ruled order**
  (`fable-answers-s323.md` §7): IO/`IO::Handle` shim → #189 `writes_args`
  (+ delete `lib/File/Basename.pm`) → #163 → #176 step 2 → #184 → #185 →
  #159 → #150 → #152 → E4.1/E5 per `docs/v2-opus5-execution-plan.md`.

## s326 (Opus, 2026-08-02): the IO/IO::Handle shim (#197) and the seven bugs under it

- **`use IO::Handle` works: `lib/IO.pm` supplies the XS half in plain Perl**
  (constants, `flush` via the `$|` idiom, `getline`/`getlines`/`gets`,
  `setbuf`/`setvbuf` mapped onto autoflush, `error`/`clearerr`/`untaint`
  answering 0 because PCL latches no error flag and has no taint), and core's
  own pure-Perl `IO/Handle.pm` runs on top of it.  `sync`/`blocking`/`ungetc`
  CROAK by name — no fsync, no fcntl, no pushback — rather than returning a
  plausible value (rule 12).
- **`lib/IO/Handle.pm` is a WORKAROUND, not a shim by choice** — core's file
  with exactly `autoflush` and `printflush` rewritten to save/restore the
  selection explicitly instead of via `SelectSaver`, whose contract is
  restore-on-DESTROY and PCL never calls DESTROY.  **Delete it when
  DESTROY-at-scope-exit lands (task #198).**  Same pattern as
  `lib/File/Basename.pm`.
- **`use Foo ()` and `use Foo qw()` must NOT call import** (verified against
  perl both ways); a bare `use Foo;` still imports with no args.  Decided
  BEFORE the import-args branch, because an empty list still parses to
  `(vector)` → `Pl/Parser.pm` `_use_has_empty_import_list`.
- **A statement modifier on `require` gates it** — `require Foo if COND;` is a
  runtime conditional, not an unconditional hoisted require.  PCL dropped the
  modifier, so `require VMS::Stdio if $^O eq 'VMS'` (File::Temp) died on Linux
  → `_include_statement_modifier`; if/unless only.
- **Perl flushes EVERY handle at exit and before fork, not just the standard
  three** — an unclosed `open my $fh,'>',$f; print {$fh} …` silently lost its
  buffer.  Registry `*p-open-output-streams*` (weak), flushed from the exit
  hook AFTER the END blocks and from `p-fork`.
- **`select(FH)` is real and `$|` is per-handle** — one-arg select sets the
  default output handle and returns the previous designator (so
  `select((select($fh), $|=1)[0])` works); setting `$|` true flushes that
  handle immediately and makes later writes flush.  Both were stubs: select
  returned a constant string and `$|` was one global flag nothing consumed.
- **open() on a GLOB handle must not overwrite the scalar** — `IO::Handle->new`
  / `\*FH` / `Symbol::gensym` produce a (usually blessed) globref; the stream
  belongs in the glob's IO slot, keyed by the glob's name.  PCL box-set the
  stream over it, so `ref($io)` stopped being `IO::Handle` and later method
  calls went elsewhere.  `%p-close-impl` now resolves through `%p-resolve-fh`
  (one resolver, every handle shape) with `%p-forget-fh` mirroring
  `%p-install-fh`.
- **A symbolic container designator resolves in `exists`/`delete` too** —
  `$$p{k}` and `$$p[i]` (and `"Pkg::"` stashes) were resolved on the
  read/write paths only, so `exists $$p{k}` silently answered NO and
  `delete $$p{k}` crashed SBCL's GETHASH.  One resolver:
  `%p-designator-hash`/`%p-designator-array`, and `p-ensure-hashref`/
  `p-ensure-arrayref` delegate their string branch to `p-cast-%`/
  `%p-symref-array` instead of keeping a second copy.
- **`delete $ref->[i]` lowers to `p-delete-array`** — `exists` had both ref
  arms all along, `delete` only the hash one, so the array form fell through
  to a one-argument `p-delete` and crashed on arity (both pipelines).
- **Capture-Tiny is NOT cleared by the shim**: its 23 FAILs move off the IO
  cause onto two string-eval bugs (task #199) — a prototyped sub defined by
  `eval "sub NAME(&;@){…}"` is never installed, and a p-eval-thunk reaches CL's
  `push` with too many arguments.  The "23 of 48" estimate in #197 assumed one
  blocker; there were three.

## s327 (Fable, 2026-08-02): s326 review + the post-#197 order

- **s326 APPROVED with two review fixes (`87f23f6`)** — both found by probing
  the seams the diff touched: close() on a name-string handle cleared the
  scalar (%p-forget-fh now mirrors %p-install-fh's name-string case), and the
  `use Foo VERSION LIST` version-skip was dead code (PPI's `$stmt->version` is
  empty for module versions) so the import args emitted a PARSE ERROR progn —
  version now recognized positionally, with the no-operator-follows guard
  (`use Foo 1.5, "x"` keeps the number a list element; probed).
- **ORDER RULING: #199 runs BEFORE #189** — the two Capture-Tiny string-eval
  bugs are the COMPLETION of post-R1 item 1, whose justification was those 23
  board FAILs.  Fix the eval-string prototyped-sub install first (the
  API-existence bug, a silent-nothing), then the p-eval-thunk→push arity;
  both are #79's area; the #142/#153 stop-rule applies if a trace lands in
  `$end_pars`.  Exit criterion: Capture-Tiny board re-run with per-file causes.
- **#198 (DESTROY at scope exit) is PARKED, design-first** — it interacts with
  #163's referent-kind tag and E5 boxed aggregates; Fable designs it after
  #163 lands (or a CPAN cause line forces it earlier).  Payoff when done:
  delete `lib/IO/Handle.pm`, unblock Try::Tiny/Scope::Guard/File::Temp
  /SelectSaver.
