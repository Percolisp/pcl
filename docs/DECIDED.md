# DECIDED.md — one-grep index of settled questions

*Grep THIS FILE before probing, designing, or writing anything up as an open
question.  One line per decision: keywords, the ruling, the pointer to the
authoritative text.  This file is an INDEX — never put the full argument
here.  When a session settles a question (user ruling, Fable review, design
doc), add a line in the same commit.  When a line turns out wrong, fix the
authoritative doc first, then the line.*

*Origin: s316v wasted real time re-deriving four already-settled facts
(review doc §7).  The rule now: read failing test → grep DECIDED.md → grep
not-supported.md → only then probe.*

## Semantics / language policy

- **DESTROY**: not fired in ANY shape (scope exit, undef, reassign, sub
  return) → `not-supported.md` §DESTROY.  Re-open as scoped R2 feature =
  OPEN user decision (`fable-answers-s316v.md` §6c).
- **Error-message text / invalid-input detection**: out of scope — PCL
  transpiles valid Perl, exact fatal text not a goal (user 2026-07-28) →
  `not-supported.md` §Error message text + CLAUDE.md 9.  Blanket
  skip-registry category approved (`fable-answers-s316v.md` §6d).
- **Ref identity / refaddr / `CODE(0x…)` / `==` on refs**: monotonic
  never-reused ids, stable across GC — deliberately NOT raw pointers →
  `ir-spec.md` §2.5.
- **Host-visible values, how far to chase perl's bytes**: match perl's
  SHAPE and invariants, not its bytes; where perl's bytes carry a defect,
  do better; exact bytes only where a program can branch on them (e.g.
  seeded rand → drand48) → `ir-spec.md` (rule), `fable-answers-s316v.md` §6h.
- **`eval $str`**: HARD REQUIREMENT, must always work, never gated (user
  2026-07-07).
- **Speed vs readable generated CL**: performance wins (user 2026-07-02) →
  CLAUDE.md §2.
- **Bareword class names** (`tie $x, Tie::StdHash`): per-builtin
  class-name-ARGUMENT-position rule reusing the `bless` bareword mechanism
  (ExprToCL `$is_bareword`), NEVER a global bareword→string rule — three
  failed global attempts recorded in task #142 → `fable-answers-s316v.md` §1.
- **PExpr operand-boundary region** (`$end_pars` maze, PExpr.pm ~2600-3700):
  do NOT add guards there; the fix is Option B's `_reduce_term` →
  `pexpr-term-parsing-review.md`.  #147 and the #138 state-init residual
  WAIT for it (`fable-answers-s316v.md` §6e, §4).
- **Flip-flop constant operands** (`"x" .. 3` vs `$.`): classify per-operand
  at the existing codegen `p-flipflop*` selection point → task #141,
  `fable-answers-s316v.md` §2.
- **quotemeta / `\w`-sensitive builtins / no per-scalar UTF8 flag**: default
  is perl's BYTE semantics; Unicode rules only under `use utf8` /
  `unicode_strings`, selected at transpile time per scope → task #146,
  `fable-answers-s316v.md` §6b.
- **pack/unpack `U` character-vs-byte modes**: implement the real mode model
  (default character mode; `U0`/`C0` switches); anything not implemented
  DIES loudly, never a silent wrong value → task #148,
  `fable-answers-s316v.md` §6j.
- **`printf %n`**: OPEN — user policy call (recommendation: bless as
  not-supported) → task #143, `fable-answers-s316v.md` §6a.
- **:crlf layer model** (#139) and **source-echo comments** (#132):
  user-held design decisions — do not start.
- **`**` float divergence**: parked → memory `project_power_op_float_divergence`.
- **mro**: C3-only, no `mro::` API / `next::method` yet →
  `not-supported.md` §mro, provider planned in `mro-plan.md`.
- **@_ aliasing, Unicode limits, and every other blessed gap**: grep
  `not-supported.md` FIRST — the answer is often already there.

## Coding rules (the ones people trip over)

- **Missing case DIES, never defaults**: a runtime `cond`/dispatch over a
  closed set of legal values ends in an explicit error naming the value,
  not a `(t …)` default — silent-wrong is the worst failure mode in the
  tree (vec-64, #138 silent drop) → CLAUDE.md 12, audit task #152.
- **Fix at the right LAYER**: module behavior → `lib/` shim; mechanisms →
  parser; core semantics → runtime → CLAUDE.md 9a.
- **Reuse, don't duplicate**: find the sibling mechanism; same logic in two
  places = hard stop → CLAUDE.md 11.
- **Never simplify a failing test**; skip only via the registry →
  CLAUDE.md 5, `test-skip-registry.md`.
- **Checked-in transpiled artifacts** (`cl/pcl-pack.lisp`, `cl/pcl-mro.lisp`):
  regenerate after emission changes (`tools/rebuild-pack`; pl2cl lib/mro.pm)
  → CLAUDE.md §Quick Reference.
- **Emission change ⇒ bump `*pcl-cache-generation*`** or stale caches run
  old codegen → CLAUDE.md §Pipelines.

## Test / triage infrastructure

- **`docs/perl-suite-run.tsv` columns**: `P`=PERL, `C`=PCL (C for CL);
  `NOTAP` means PERL produced no TAP (row not comparable — says nothing
  bad about PCL) → legend at top of the tsv; source
  `tools/run-perl-suite.pl`.
- **`.suitelog/*.fails.tsv` description column is PERL's test line**, values
  interpolated by perl — never read it as PCL's output.
- **XDIFF registration bar**: a file gets an `perl-suite-expected.tsv` row
  ONLY when every failing test in it is explained by a blessed
  `not-supported.md` section — partially-explained files stay UNEXPLAINED
  → `perl-suite-expected.tsv` header, `fable-answers-s316v.md` §6f.
- **Copied-file corpus split**: t/ originals are authoritative; the runner
  no longer hides a t/ file behind a `perl-tests/` copy of the same name;
  drifted copies re-sync post-R1 → task #150, `fable-answers-s316v.md` §6i.
- **v1 is the emission ORACLE until E4.1** (`PCL_V1=1 ./pl2cl`) — copy its
  shape when correct, don't invent one → `v2-opus5-execution-plan.md` §2.
- **New Pl/t tests** → smallest `transpile-test-NN.t`, cap ~50/file, never
  -01 (user 2026-07-28).
- **Failed attempts are recorded IN the task** (what was tried, what killed
  it) — a task that says what NOT to retry outranks one that only states
  the goal.
