# ── Bug 1: triple dereference $$$ref is mis-tokenized as the PID var $$ ────────
#
# $$$ref means ${ ${ $ref } } (a triple scalar deref).  Compare $$ref, which PPI
# correctly gives as Cast '$' + Symbol '$ref'.  For $$$ref PPI instead emits the
# special process-ID variable $$ (PPI::Token::Magic) + Symbol '$ref', so the
# extra dereference is lost and there is no PID variable in this code at all.

# ── Bug 1b: $${EXPR} — the same mis-lex, plus a STRUCTURE error on the braces ──
#
# $${$ref} means ${ ${$ref} }.  PPI emits Magic '$$' again, and then — because
# the braces follow what it believes is a variable — structures them as a
# PPI::Structure::Subscript, i.e. a hash key.  Compare ${$ref}, which PPI
# correctly gives as Cast '$' + PPI::Structure::Block.  A consumer that repairs
# only the Magic still has a subscript with no base in front of it.

# ── Bug 2: C99 hex-float literal 0x1.8p+1 is split into 5 tokens ───────────────
#
# Perl 5.22+ accepts hex floating-point literals; 0x1.8p+1 == 3.0 is ONE number.

# Operator '+' + Number '1'.

# ── Bug 3: 7%-3 mis-tokenized as the magic hash %- (modulo operator lost) ──────
#
# `%-`/`%+` are the named-capture magic *hashes*; they only ever appear in term
# position.  In `7%-3` the `%` follows a term (7) so it is the modulo operator
# and `-3` is its operand — exactly what PPI gives for the spaced form `7 % -3`.
# PPI instead emits Magic `%-`, losing the `%` operator.

    my @t = toks('7%-3');

# ── Bug 4: for ${*$f} (LIST) {} — LEXER DIES ("Illegal state in 'for' …") ──────
#
# A block-deref lvalue as the foreach loop variable is valid Perl (it aliases
# the glob's scalar slot per iteration):
#
#   $ perl -e 'no strict "refs"; my $f = "v"; for ${*$f} (5,11,33) { print "$v " }'
#   5 11 33
#
# (It appears in perl's own test suite: t/op/for.t, the low-refcount-package-var
# assert/SEGV regression test.)  PPI::Document->new returns undef on it —
# not a mis-tokenization but a hard lexer failure:
#   Lexer failed: Illegal state in 'for' compound statement
# Plain `for $x (…)` is fine; `foreach ${*$f} (…)` fails identically, as does
# the construct buried anywhere in a larger document (the whole parse dies).
{
    my $src = 'no strict "refs"; my $f = "v"; for ${*$f} (5,11,33) { print }';
    my $doc = PPI::Document->new(\$src);

# ── Bug 5: a VARIABLE declaration's attribute is not a Token::Attribute ────────
#
# `my $x : shared = 1;` is valid Perl (prints 1).  PPI produces a
# PPI::Token::Attribute for the same syntax on a SUB (`sub f : lvalue {…}`),
# but inside a PPI::Statement::Variable the attribute run comes back as a bare
# Operator ':' plus ordinary Words — indistinguishable from an unrelated
# expression fragment, so a consumer that supports `my $x <trailing expr>`
# silently takes ": shared = 1" as that expression.
{
    my @t = toks('my $x : shared = 1;');
    ok( grep(/^PPI::Token::Attribute=/, @t),
        'my $x : shared = 1 should yield a Token::Attribute, as sub attributes do' )
        or diag "got: @t";
}

# ── Bug 6: ${ PUNCTUATION } is a variable, but lexes as Cast + Block ───────────
#
# Perl's ${ NAME } accepts a punctuation name, so @{+} IS the magic array @+
# (and ${!} is $!, %{+} is %+):
#
#   $ perl -e '"ab" =~ /(a)/; print "@{+}"'
#   a
#
# PPI already folds the IDENTIFIER spelling (@{foo} -> @foo) and the caret
# spelling, but leaves the punctuation ones as Cast + Block{lone Operator}.  A
# deref block holding exactly one Operator token can never be an expression, so
# the fold is unambiguous.
{
    my @t = toks('@{+}');
    ok( !grep(/^PPI::Token::Structure=\{$/, @t),
        '@{+} should fold to the magic array @+, as @{foo} folds to @foo' )
        or diag "got: @t";

# ── Bug 7: `for` takes only [my] $scalar, and swallows the rest of the file ────
#
# Both of these are valid Perl — `for \my %e (@l)` (refaliasing, 5.22+) and
# `for my ($q, $r) (@l)` (n-at-a-time, 5.36+).  PPI's loop-variable slot accepts
# neither, and unlike bug 4 it does not fail loudly: the Statement::Compound
# keeps ONLY the keyword, and the rest of the construct plus every following
# statement up to the next ';' is swallowed into one flat sibling statement.  So
# a consumer sees a `for` with no list and no block, and loses unrelated code
# with it.  (Compare `for my $q (@l) { A() } print "x";`, which parses into two
# statements as expected.)
{
    my $src = 'for my ($q, $r) (@l) { A() } print "x";';
    my $doc = PPI::Document->new(\$src);
    my ($first) = $doc ? $doc->schildren : ();

        or diag "compound was: " . ($first ? $first->content : '(no parse)');
}

# ── Bug 8: /PATTERN/ after a paren-less WORD is read as division ───────────────
#
# After a bareword that is not a known unary operator, perl expects a TERM, so
# the `/` starts a match against $_:
#
#   $ perl -e 'sub ok { print "ok(@_)\n" } $_ = "aa"; ok /a/, "desc"'
#   ok(1 desc)
#   $ perl -e '$_ = "aa"; print /a/, "\n"'      # print, a core list operator
#   1
#
# PPI already gets this right after `grep`, `return`, `(` and `=`, but after any
# other Word it emits Operator '/' + Word + Operator '/' — i.e. two divisions —
# so the match, and the whole argument list with it, is lost.  A consumer cannot
# recover it: the pattern's own text has been re-tokenized as code.

}
# The statement MODIFIERS are the same bug and the same fix: `if` and `unless`
# are right, `while` and `until` are not.  Their damage is worse than `ok`'s,

# the CLOSING delimiter starts a match of its own and swallows the rest of the

# ── Bug 9: `)*name` is lexed as a GLOB instead of multiplication ──────────────
#
# A `*` where a term has just ENDED can only be multiplication; a glob starts

# ── Bug 10: parsing depends on $/ — a trailing __END__ gains a newline ────────
#
# `$/` is the input-record separator for READING; it has no business affecting
# how source text is tokenized.  With `$/` undef (slurp mode — what code that
# has just read the source with `local $/` leaves behind), a document whose last

# longer the identity, and the DATA section gains a line the file never had.

# ── Bug 30: an indented here-doc's INDENTATION over-counts when the delimiter
#            itself begins with whitespace, or is empty ──────────────────────
#
# perl strips the whitespace standing BEFORE the delimiter TEXT on the
# terminator line.  PPI::Token::HereDoc::_indent takes `^(\s*)` of the WHOLE
# terminator line, so `<<~' EOF'` counts the delimiter's own leading space as
# indentation (and `<<~''` counts the NEWLINE); _is_match_indent then fails and
# the body is left unstripped — or, when the body is indented as far as the
# over-count, it is stripped one character too many.
